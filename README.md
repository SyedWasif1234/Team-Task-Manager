# Team Task Manager Backend

Welcome to the **Team Task Manager Backend**! This server handles everything needed to manage teams, projects, and tasks for your application.

## 🚀 What does this do?

This backend provides all the necessary APIs (the hidden brain of the app) for a Team Task Manager. It is built using **Node.js, Express, and Prisma** (with a PostgreSQL database).

Here is a simple breakdown of what it handles:
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and securely access the app.
- **Teams**: You can create a team, invite other users by their email, and assign them roles like `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, or `MEMBER`.
- **Projects**: Inside a team, you can create multiple projects to organize your work.
- **Tasks**: Inside a project, you can create tasks, assign them to team members, set a priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical), and track their status (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).
- **Dashboard**: Get a quick summary of how many tasks are done, pending, or overdue.

## 🛠️ How to start the server

1. Open your terminal in the `Backend` folder.
2. Install the dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *(This will use `nodemon` so the server automatically restarts when you make changes).*

4. The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🗄️ Database

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.




Enjoy managing your tasks! 🚀
